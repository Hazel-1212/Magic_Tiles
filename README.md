# Magic_Tiles
## Intro
- This final project is an FPGA music game inspired by Magic Tiles. 
- We modified the single-player gameplay into a two-player mode, where one player handles the main melody and the other plays the accompaniment. 
- Each tile now corresponds to a specific number on the keypad.
## Features
- Enable communication between the FPGA and Python through bidirectional UART serial ports. 
- Allow the user to visualize the game using their own laptop. 
BTW, the UART connection can come either from the built-in ports on the development board or from the AD2 (Analog Discovery 2) pins.
